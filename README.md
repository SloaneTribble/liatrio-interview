# liatrio-interview

*For this interview, we are going to ask you to create a simple web application which exposes a
HTTP API endpoint and use a CI/CD pipeline to containerize it and deploy it to a cloud platform.
We have this exercise broken down into general sections, and while there are many ways to
accomplish each, we note some tools you should use. It is possible that you may have
experience using other tools, but you should stick to our suggestions when and where possible.*
